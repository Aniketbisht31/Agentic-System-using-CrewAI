# Agentic-System-using-CrewAI
An autonomous, multi-agent system built using CrewAI that create intelligent agents that collaborate to perform complex workflows This project demonstrates how specialized AI agents can be connected, assigned roles, and coordinated to plan, execute, and reason through tasks in a fully or semi-autonomous manner. one can add new agents or API 
 The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from a modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines
